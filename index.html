    <h1>Using Monte Carlo Method to Calculate RNG-Based Game
    </h1>
  </div>

  <div class="content"> 
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center;">
      Let's say you are playing an RNG game. There's a rare loot from a boss which only drop 1% each time you kill him. So you have to grind that. <br><br>
      The question is: if you're grinding <span style="font-size: xx-large;"> 100 times </span>, what are the odds that you'll get at least <span style="font-size: xx-large;"> 1 loot drop </span>? <br><br>
      One solution is to use complex statistical method to solve it. But since we have the power of computational system in our hands, why not use it? <br><br>
      We're going to simulate, let's say 10000 people who are going to grind that boss. Each person are going kill 100 bosses. We're going to see the loot drop from these people. <br><br>
      To give you a start, let's try to fill the box below with 10000, 100, 0.01 respectively.

  <div class="form box-200 text-smaller" style="font-size: medium;">
    <form id="form1" action="/action_page.php">
      Number of People Who Tries: <br><input id="iteration" style="min-width: 250px;" type="text" name="fname"><br>
      Number of Attempt per Person: <br><input id="nTry" style="min-width: 250px;" type="text" name="nTry"><br>
      Probability of success: <br><input id="probability" style="min-width: 250px;" type="text" name="lname"><br><br>

      Notice that everytime you click submit, the number will change. This is because the computer generates a new random people. <br>
      The more "Number of People Who Tries" that you input, the more accurate the result. But this will take the computer longer to compute.<br>
      Monte Carlo has some interesting background.
